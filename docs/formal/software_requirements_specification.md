### 7.2 Layer Responsibilities Summary

| Application | Use cases, ports | Domain | Integration |
| Infrastructure | Adapters (driven) | App + Domain | Integration |
| Presentation | UI (driving) | Application ONLY | Integration (23) |
| Bootstrap | DI wiring | ALL | Integration |

### 7.3 Static Dispatch Pattern

```go
// Bootstrap instantiates with concrete types
consoleWriter := adapter.NewConsoleWriter()
greetUseCase := usecase.NewGreetUseCase[*adapter.ConsoleWriter](consoleWriter)
greetCommand := command.NewGreetCommand[*usecase.GreetUseCase[*adapter.ConsoleWriter]](greetUseCase)

// All method calls are statically dispatched (no vtable)
exitCode := greetCommand.Run(args)
```

### 7.4 Dependency Graph

```
Bootstrap
    |
Presentation -> Application -> Domain
    |              |
Infrastructure ----+
```

**Critical Rule**: Presentation cannot access Domain directly (enforced by arch_guard.py)
